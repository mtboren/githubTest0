githubTest0 Docs!
===========
### Some docs for the GitHub testing repo

| What | Why |
|-------|------|
Add tables | So that stuff looks better
Have docs  | So that people know what is up
Just started | Because this is an intro
Make branches | So we can work in harmony more easily

### Use Markdown
- So that we have cross-platform (including web) readable documents
- Reference at [Daring Fireball: Markdown Syntax Documentation](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
